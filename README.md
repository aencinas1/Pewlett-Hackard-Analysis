# Pewlett Hackard Analysis
In this challenge, we build further analysis off of our previous module work. Now, Pewlett Hackard is asking for additional assignments. First, they would like for me to determine the number of retiring employees per title and provide a count of how many people will be retiring per title. Second, they would like to identify senior employees who would be eligible to participate as mentors in a new mentorship program. From the provided data, we can certainly find what they are asking for.
